# Spotify Spotter

## Introduction
We have created an application that allows users to login with their Spotify account and access their listening stats all year-round. 

Users are also able toâ€¦ 
- View global top charts
- View their top artists, songs, and genres 
- Create customized playlists based on their listening history and patterns

While the widely popular Spotify Wrapped allows users to access their stats every year at the beginning of December, our application allows users to access this data whenever they want it. 

## Technical Architecture

**Backend**: 
Uses the Flask framework. When a user makes request, triggers a request in the corresponding Flask route allowing the backend to compile a response and send it to the user. 
Functionalities include caching, authenticating users using Spotify, and fetching listening data. 

**Frontend**: 
uses the React library and JavaScript. Has a dynamic user interface. 
Four different pages including a homepage, login page, user data page, and global charts page.
